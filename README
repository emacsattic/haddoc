Description
===========

Haddoc is a simple tool that allows an emacs user to search the Python HTML
documentation indexes and to bring a web browser to an index term page.


Motivation
----------

Even though I have the Python TexInfo documentation installed from my Emacs,
somehow I always end up browsing the documentation from a web browser.  Most of
the time I start from either the Python Library Reference or from the index.  I
wanted to be able to bring up the documentation from within Emacs.   This does
it.  

With haddoc, you invoke the elisp function ``haddoc-lookup`` (I type ``C-c .``),
enter some search terms, and the matches from the Python indexes are shown in a
buffer, from which you can select to direct your external web browser to.  I
like to drive an external Firefox with it.


Design
------

I took the simple approach and wrote a combination of Emacs-LISP and Python code
to implement this:

* ``haddoc-update``: a Python script that will parse the HTML documentation
  indexes and generate a mapping of the index entries to the HTML pages in a DBM
  database (in ``/var/lib/haddoc/haddoc.db`` by default)

* ``haddoc-lookup``: a Python script that does a lookup of search terms
  (potentially incomplete) on the index keys and returns the page references for
  each of the search terms on stdout

* ``haddoc.el``: an Emacs-LISP package that can query the results of
  ``haddoc-lookup`` and spawn a webbrowser to the appropriate pages.


Documentation
=============

Use the source.

.. note:: 
   
   This will not work on Python HTML documentation before Python-2.3.3.  Update
   your documentation if necessary (or fix the code).

Download
========

- `Download </downloads/haddoc/>`_


Installation
============

* Download the code and unpack it.  Install it using ``distutils``::

     python setup.py install

  (You may need to run this as superuser.)

* Initialize the haddoc database::

     haddoc-update file:///path/to/python/html

  (You may need to run this as superuser.)  Note that you can specify an URL to
  the online documentation if desired.

  By default the database will be created in ``/var/lib/haddoc``; If you would
  like to create it someplace else, use the appropriate option, for example::

     haddoc-update -D /home/myuser/.haddoc/haddoc.db <URL>

* Try running the lookup tool from the command-line::

     haddoc-lookup waitpid

  You should get some result lines.  If this does not work, fix the problem.

* Copy ``haddoc.el`` somewhere in your Emacs load-path, and add something like
  this to your ``.emacs`` in your Python customizations section to create a
  binding in ``python-mode``::

    (require 'haddoc)
    (define-key py-mode-map [(control c)(?.)] 'haddoc-lookup)

  You may need to require ``'python-mode``.

* Customize the elisp package ``browse-url.el`` if you don't like the way that
  the browser is controlled, or to select your favourite browser program.


Dependencies
------------

* Requires Python and Emacs.


Portability
-----------

* I have not tried with Xemacs, and I won't.  If you want to fix it, send me the
  changes.  Otherwise I won't bother. 


Reporting Bugs
==============

* I will be happy to integrate patches if you can submit them (I will not debug
  your ``.emacs``).
